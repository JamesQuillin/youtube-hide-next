# youtube-hide-next Chrome Extension

The extension becomes active when on YouTube and if you click it the "up next" section of the page is hidden. I put this together the other day just to help someone out who was watching tournaments that were in a best of five format so that they wouldn't have, e.g. game three spoiled by seeing that there is a game four coming up.

You can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-hide-next/jjkjjijbhgchlnoncjikpmlkabafgohd) if you want to add it to chrome.
